# Linear_Regression_Stocks_Python

A model set for predictive analysis using linear regression and easy machine learning.  


Our explanatory variables in this model strategy are the moving averages for past 3 days and 9 days for the stock price. 

Remember that when you have more empty variables in a list you increase away from a point, and you begin to mess with limits (calculus fun)

so we will be using the dropna() function and store the feature variables in X.

we will be using the sklearn.linear_model, importing its LinearRegression function,
our accuracy for NSRGY (Nestl√© S.A.) is 96.64% correct to using this model, as time goes on I will add to this, evenatually using other models.


btw 96.64% meaning it was accurate.
